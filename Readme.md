# K-means clustering algorithm

it's an implementation of k-means algorithm using Java.

## Description

•	Consider the household power consumption data set in the file named Power_Consumption.csv, it contains the power consumption information of 200 households.

•	The program is grouping these households based on the similarity in their power consumption using k-means Algorithm.

•	Initial centroids are chosen randomly.

•	The number of clusters (K) and the distance function (Manhattan or Euclidean) are provided as input from the user during runtime.

•   The final output of the program shows k lists of households’ IDs and their information, and shows outlier records (if exist).
